# COCO Mechanics

Here we present a list of routines for analysis of mechanics problems, including

 * extract backbone curve of undamped and unforcd systems
 * extract forced response curve (FRC) of mechanical systems
 * extract damped backbone curve of (DBC) mechanical systems

The computation of DBC is formulated as an optimization problem. Please refer to [1,2] for more details about solving optimization problems in COCO.
